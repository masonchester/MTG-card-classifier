pip install all dependencies in requirements and run download_dataset.py

download_dataset.py generates an image directory that splits into train test and validation
train 70%, validation 15%, test 15%

@ me ill explain anything if any confusion, just have process_cards.json and download_dataset.py in the same directory, image dir will be created in that dir
